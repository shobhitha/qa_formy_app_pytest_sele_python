This project automates testing of formy_app(https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/). The entire framework is based on Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with separate project directories (pages, tests, locators, reports etc.) for reducing code duplication and improving test maintenance. You can either run a specified test or all tests at once with HTML reports generated after test completion.

**Technilogies used for automation framework are:**

Python : Programming language
Selenium Webdriver : Automation framework for web-applications
pytest :  Python testing framework
pytest-html: plugin for pytest that generates a HTML report for test results
